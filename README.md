# 🚀 My DSA Journey

Welcome to my **DSA Journey Repository**!  
I’m dividing my DSA practice into **Easy, Medium, and Hard** sections, documenting everything here so that I (and anyone learning) can track progress clearly.

While being busy in development projects, I’ll still dedicate consistent time to **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**.  
I’ve already solved a good number of problems on LeetCode and GeeksforGeeks, but from now onwards, I will **document each portion** here.

## 📂 Structure
- `Easy/` → Beginner-friendly problems with explanations  
- `Medium/` → Intermediate-level challenges  
- `Hard/` → Advanced problems, optimized solutions
